# Adithya's Workspace

## Hello Adithya!

This file is the medium of communication between us for the Major Project

You will find important work assigned to you and your TODO's below.

I will however post a message after a new work is assigned. 

This might be hard but this makes our work uniform and systematic.

Please be aware that since you are new to programming, work assigning for you wont be as same as Barath's

## This week TODO's
#### Last updated on August 20


Employee ID can be specified my user and user must be prompted to ask for **monthly salary**

Do all this with your localhost MySQL and upload the python files to This folder _Major-Project-2021/Adithya's Files_

Also you must develop an interface for connecting Python and MySQL to help the user add / edit / delete employees
