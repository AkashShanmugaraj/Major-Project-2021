# Adithya's Workspace

## Hello Adithya!

This file is the medium of communication between us for the Major Project

You will find important work assigned to you and your TODO's below.

I will however post a message after a new work is assigned. 

This might be hard but this makes our work uniform and systematic.

Please be aware that since you are new to programming, work assigning for you wont be as same as Barath's
